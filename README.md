# What

Yis was a hackathon project of two Sauce Labs engineers - Kuba and Callum. 
It's a slack bot that helps users staying up to date with all the pull requests on github they're assigned to as well
as commits that they were mentioned in.

# Technologies used

MongoDB
NodeJS
ES6/2015 (babel)
pm2
cron

# Prerequisites

This bot is meant to be run within organizations having private repositories, but probably it'll also work with normal user accounts. To set it up a user with permissions
to access repositories will be needed as well as a personal token for accessing GitHub API and which can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
Other than that, server running the bot needs a MongoDB instance running. We also suggest to install `pm2` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2
